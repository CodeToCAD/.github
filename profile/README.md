# CodeToCAD - code-based modeling automation

CodeToCAD brings intuitive and reliable code-based automation to your favorite 3D modeling software (e.g. Blender and OnShape). 

Unlike other code-based CAD (e.g. CADQuery and OpenSCAD), CodeToCAD interfaces directly with existing modeling software (like Blender and OnShape). Therefore, you can keep using the software you love, but leverage the power of code and automation in your work. You don't need to be a great programmer to use CodeToCAD - there will be a cheat-sheet and documentation to help you get started.

## Integrations

Current integrations:
- [CodeToCAD-Blender](https://github.com/CodeToCad/CodeToCad-Blender)

Future planned integrations:
- OnShape
- ThreeJS
- Electronic CAD (suggestions welcome)


## Benefits of code-based modeling with CodeToCAD:

âœ… Simplified modeling interface - it's all text! No more scrolling and clicking into sub-menus to edit your models.

ðŸ”“ Not vendor locked - your models are created in an open-source language. If you want to use another software, you do not lose the features you have defined. Note: There is no guarantee that a model created for, e.g. Blender, will work right away for another software, but with some refactoring, it theoretically should!

ðŸª¶ Lightweight and portable. All you need is a text-editor to model. You can occasionally fire-up your modeling software to run your creations.

ðŸ’ª Leverages existing programming languages, like Python. You can keep using the languages you're familiar with and love. There is no one-off language you and your team has to learn. Use CodeToCAD like a library or a framework.

ðŸš¦Easy version control. Your models are written in code, you can use industry-loved git to keep track of versions of your models.

ðŸ’• Built by people who believe in automation and that modeling workflows should be intuitive, reliable and most importantly free and open source!
